# Nargo

`nargo` is a command line tool for interacting with Noir programs (e.g. compiling, proving,
verifying and more).

Alternatively, the interactions can also be performed in [TypeScript](../typescript.md).

## Installation

There are three approaches to install Nargo:

- [Option 1: Noirup](#option-1-noirup)
- [Option 2: Binaries](#option-2-binaries)
- [Option 3: Compile from Source](#option-3-compile-from-source)

Optionally you can also install [Noir VS Code extension] for syntax highlighting.

### Option 1: Noirup

If you're on OSX or Linux, the easiest way to start using Noir and Nargo is via noirup. Just open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noir-lang/noirup/main/install | bash
```

Close the terminal, open another one, and run

```bash
noirup
```

Done, you should have the correct version working. You can also install nightlies, specific versions
or branches, check out the [noirup repository](https://github.com/noir-lang/noirup) for more
information

#### GitHub Actions

You can use `noirup` with GitHub Actions for CI/CD and automated testing. It is as simple as
installing `noirup` and running tests in your GitHub Action `yml` file.

See the
[config file](https://github.com/TomAFrench/noir-hashes/blob/master/.github/workflows/noir.yml) in
this repo containing hash functions in Noir for an example.

### Option 2: Binaries

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/releases) for the latest and previous
platform specific binaries.

#### Step 1

Paste and run the following in the terminal to extract and install the binary:

> **macOS / Linux:** If you are prompted with `Permission denied` when running commands, prepend
> `sudo` and re-run it.

##### macOS (Apple Silicon)

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.nargo/bin && \
curl -o $HOME/.nargo/bin/nargo-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz -L https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/releases/download/v0.4.1/nargo-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz && \
tar -xvf $HOME/.nargo/bin/nargo-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz -C $HOME/.nargo/bin/ && \
echo '\nexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.nargo/bin' >> ~/.zshrc && \
source ~/.zshrc
```

##### macOS (Intel)

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.nargo/bin && \
curl -o $HOME/.nargo/bin/nargo-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz -L https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/releases/download/v0.4.1/nargo-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz && \
tar -xvf $HOME/.nargo/bin/nargo-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz -C $HOME/.nargo/bin/ && \
echo '\nexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.nargo/bin' >> ~/.zshrc && \
source ~/.zshrc
```

##### Windows (PowerShell)

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
mkdir -f -p "$env:USERPROFILE\.nargo\bin\"; `
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/releases/download/v0.4.1/nargo-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip -Outfile "$env:USERPROFILE\.nargo\bin\nargo-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip"; `
Expand-Archive -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.nargo\bin\nargo-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip" -DestinationPath "$env:USERPROFILE\.nargo\bin\"; `
$Reg = "Registry::HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment"; `
$OldPath = (Get-ItemProperty -Path "$Reg" -Name PATH).Path; `
$NewPath = $OldPath + ’;’ + "$env:USERPROFILE\.nargo\bin\"; `
Set-ItemProperty -Path "$Reg" -Name PATH –Value "$NewPath"; `
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
```

##### Linux (Bash)

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.nargo/bin && \
curl -o $HOME/.nargo/bin/nargo-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -L https://github.com/noir-lang/noir/releases/download/v0.4.1/nargo-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz && \
tar -xvf $HOME/.nargo/bin/nargo-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -C $HOME/.nargo/bin/ && \
echo -e '\nexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.nargo/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && \
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Step 2

Check if the installation was successful by running `nargo --help`.

> **macOS:** If you are prompted with an OS alert, right-click and open the _nargo_ executable from
> Finder. Close the new terminal popped up and `nargo` should now be accessible.

For a successful installation, you should see something similar to the following after running the
command:

```
$ nargo --help

Noir's package manager

Usage: nargo <COMMAND>

Commands:
   check             Checks the constraint system for errors
   codegen-verifier  Generates a Solidity verifier smart contract for the program
   compile           Compile the program and its secret execution trace into ACIR format
   new               Create a new binary project
   execute           Executes a circuit to calculate its return value
   prove             Create proof for this program. The proof is returned as a hex encoded string
   verify            Given a proof and a program, verify whether the proof is valid
   test              Run the tests for this program
   gates             Counts the occurrences of different gates in circuit
   help              Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

### Option 3: Compile from Source

#### Setup

1. Install [Git] and [Rust].

2. Download Noir's source code from Github by running:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:noir-lang/noir.git
   ```

3. Change directory into the Noir project and checkout the v0.4.1 release by running:

   ```bash
   cd noir && git checkout tags/v0.4.1
   ```

Note that you can install the latest version by building the project directly from the `master`
branch, but this may not work as expected or may include undocumented features since it is not an
official release.

There are then two approaches to proceed, differing in how the proving backend is installed:

#### Option 2.1: Install Executable with WASM backend

4. Install Nargo by running:

   ```bash
   cargo install --locked --path=crates/nargo_cli --no-default-features --features plonk_bn254_wasm
   ```

#### Option 2.2: Install Executable with Native Backend

The [barretenberg] proving backend is written in C++, hence compiling it from source would first
require certain dependencies to be installed.

4. Install [CMake], [LLVM] and [OpenMP]:

##### macOS

Installing through [Homebrew] is recommended:

```bash
brew install cmake llvm libomp
```

##### Ubuntu (Linux)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install clang lld cmake libomp-dev
```

Other variants of Linux will need to adjust the commands for their package manager.

##### Windows

```sh
TBC
```

5. Install Nargo by running:

   ```bash
   cargo install --locked --path=crates/nargo_cli
   ```

#### Verify Installation

6. Check if the installation was successful by running `nargo --version`:

   ```
   $ nargo --version
   nargo 0.4.1 (git version hash: 29b1f7df4d563849a62e64c533cb62932188135b, is dirty: false)
   ```
