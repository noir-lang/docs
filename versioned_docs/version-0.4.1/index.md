This version of the book is being released with the public alpha. There will be a lot of features
that are missing in this version, however the syntax and the feel of the language will mostly be
completed.

## What is Noir?

Noir is a domain specific language for creating and verifying proofs. It's design choices are
influenced heavily by Rust.

## What's new about Noir?

Noir is much more simple and flexible in design as it does not compile immediately to a fixed
NP-complete language. Instead Noir compiles to an intermediate language which itself can be compiled
to an arithmetic circuit or a rank-1 constraint system. This in itself brings up a few challenges
within the design process, but allows one to decouple the programming language completely from the
backend. This is similar in theory to LLVM.

## Who is Noir for?

Noir can be used for a variety of purposes.

### Ethereum Developers

Noir currently includes a command to publish a contract which verifies your Noir program. This will
be modularised in the future, however as of the alpha you can use the `contract` command to create
it.

### Protocol Developers

As a protocol developer, you may not want to use the Aztec backend due to it not being a fit for
your stack or maybe you simply want to use a different proving system. Since Noir does not compile
to a specific proof system, it is possible for protocol developers to replace the PLONK based
proving system with a different proving system altogether.

### Blockchain developers

As a blockchain developer, you will be constrained by parameters set by your blockchain, ie the
proving system and smart contract language has been pre-defined. In order for you to use Noir in
your blockchain, a proving system backend must be implemented for it and a smart contract interface
must be implemented for it.
